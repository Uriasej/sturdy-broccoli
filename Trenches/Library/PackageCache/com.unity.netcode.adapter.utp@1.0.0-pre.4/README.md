Unity Transport for Netcode for GameObjects is a transport adapter which enables the use of [Unity Transport Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@1.0/manual/index.html) as a low-level transport for Netcode for GameObjects.

This library is an implementation of NetworkTransport to provide configuration and interoperability for Unity Transport with the Netcode for GameObjects package, enabling cross platform UDP-based network communication to a Unity project.
