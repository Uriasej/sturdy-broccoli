    - If two or more rules have the same priority, they will be evaluated from newest to oldest (the oldest rule will overwrite the matching keys of newer rules)
    - The rule priority can be set by the new column in the RS Management window in the list of rules.
- The workflow for adding a Remote Setting to a rule has changed: No more dropdown. Now, on a Rule, all Remote Settings will be visible, and in order to add it to a rule, just click the checkbox to the left of the key. And to remove it, just uncheck the same box.
