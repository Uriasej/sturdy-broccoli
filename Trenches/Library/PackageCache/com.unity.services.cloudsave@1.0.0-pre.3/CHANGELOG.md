## [1.0.0-pre.3] - 2020-10-14
* All models that weren't documented have been made internal as they were not designed to be used externally
* Improved documentation (sample scene and annotations).
* Updated dependencies (Core and Authentication).

## [1.0.0] - 2020-08-17
* Open Beta release
* Updated dependencies (Core and Authentication).
* Methods marked with `Obsolete` annotations have been removed.
* `LoadAsync` has been split into two separate methods: `LoadAsyncAll` and `LoadAsync(HashSet<string> keys)`. 
* Both Load-related methods now return `Dictionary<string, string>`, with a JSON serialized value that needs to be deserialized by the user.
* Package-specific error types are now: `CloudSaveException` and `CloudSaveValidationException` (More properties are now available for debugging the issues).
* Removed Moq dependency from the package.
* CloudSaveSample was transformed into the code-example.

## [0.5.0-preview] - 2021-07-30

 * Core SDK has been updated to `v.1.1.0-pre.5`.
 * Authentication package version is now on version `1.0.0-pre.1`.
 * Internals were updated to use the latest REST APIs from the Cloud Save Service for the long-term resiliency.
 * Interface methods have been renamed to be in sync with the Unity naming convention. All public async functions now include `Async` suffix. Old methods are still available, but with `Obsolete` annotation. They will be removed as a part of the next release.
